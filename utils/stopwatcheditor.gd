extends Node

## A stopwatch node that can be used to measure time in the game.
##
## The stopwatch can be used to measure time in the game. It can be started, stopped, and paused.
## The stopwatch can also be set to autostart, which will start the stopwatch when the scene is loaded.
## It is based on a [Timer] node, so it has the same issues as the Timer node.


## The process callback for the stopwatch.
enum StopwatchProcessCallback {
	STOPWATCH_PROCESS_PHYSICS = 0, ## Update the stopwatch during physics frames (see [enum Timer.TimerProcessCallback]).
	STOPWATCH_PROCESS_IDLE = 1, ## Update the stopwatch during idle frames (see [enum Timer.TimerProcessCallback]).
}

const MAX_TIME = 1000000000

## If `true`, the stopwatch will automatically start when entering the scene tree. See [member Timer.autostart].
@export var autostart: bool = false
## If `true`, the stopwatch is paused and will not process until it is unpaused again, even if [method start] is called. See [member Timer.paused].
@export var paused: bool = false
@export var process_callback: StopwatchProcessCallback = StopwatchProcessCallback.STOPWATCH_PROCESS_IDLE
## The stopwatch's current time in seconds. [br]
## [b] Note [/b]: This property is read-only.

## Returns `true` if the stopwatch is stopped.
func is_stopped() -> bool:

## Starts the stopwatch. Sets the stopwatch's time to `initial_time`.
func start(initial_time: float = 0.0) -> void:
	_time = initial_time
	timer.start()

## Stops the stopwatch.
func stop() -> void:

## Starts the stopwatch with the time it was stopped at.
func resume() -> void:
	start(_stopped_time)
